# Neighborly Project

Neighborly is a Python Flask-powered web application that allows neighbors to post advertisements for services and products they can offer.

## Frontend
The Neighborly project is comprised of a front-end application that is built with the Python Flask micro-framework. The application allows the user to view, create, edit, and delete the community advertisements.

## Backend
The application makes direct requests to the back-end API endpoints. These are endpoints that we will also build for the server-side of the application.

## Screenshots 
Submission screenshots are available in the screenshots folder. They are arranged in order as per project rubric.
